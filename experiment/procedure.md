### Procedure
Select the components from the right side of the simulator and connect them as in figure .1.
<br>1 Black color appears at the  end of the wires when the connection is complete.
<br>2 Choose values for resistor, capacitor ,inductor and Battery.
<br>3 Find out the resonance frequency using the equation.
<br>4 Vary the frequency of A.C Power source below and above resonant frequency of the circuit and measure the current at each frequency using a non-contact ammeter
<br>5 Plot graph by taking frequency along X-axis and current along Y-axis.
