<h2> Theory:</h2> <br>
<p>(Series L-C-R) When the resistor R, inductor L and
capacitor C are connected in series with a source of emf E , the circuit is called as the
series resonant or series tuned circuit ( figure-1). This is an acceptor circuit, that means it
allows maximum current to flow through it at a particular ( resonant ) frequency and at all
other frequencies it allows less current. </p><br>

In A.C. circuits the voltage and the current are usually out of phase. Across the
inductor, the current lags behind the voltage by 900
, where as across the capacitor, the
current leads the voltage by 900
. But across the resistor the voltage and current both are in phase. Under certain conditions, the voltage and current are in phase, even though the
circuit consists of L , C and R and the circuit behaves as a pure resistor. This
phenomenon is called resonance. This occurs at a single frequency known as resonant
frequency. At this frequency the capacitive reactance( Xc = 1/ωC) and the inductive
reactance( X<sub>L </sub>= ωL) are equal and opposite in direction. So they get cancelled each other
and only resistance acts.<br>

<b>The impedance of the circuit is given by</b> <br>
Z = R + j (ωL- 1/ωC ) <br>
<b>At resonance the reactive term disappears</b> <br>
ωL - 1/ωC = 0           <br>
<b>The impedance is minimum i.e.</b> <br>
Z = R <br>
<b>The current is maximum </b><br>
<b>So </b>      
        ωL = 1/ωC <br>

<p>At this frequency the current is maximum and this frequency f0 is called resonant
frequency. The circuit has selective properties. To compare selectivity or sharpness of
resonance, a band of frequencies is chosen at which the current falls to
2
1
 times ( half
power points ) of its maximum value. The frequency difference (f2 – f1 ) between the half
power points is called the bandwidth.<p>
